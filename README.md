Hey there! I'm José, a Software Engineer who calls the vibrant city of Leeds, in England, home. My coding journey kicked off at a bootcamp, and boy, what a ride it's been! From there, I landed an apprenticeship at an EdTech company, where my knowledge expanded faster than JavaScript's ecosystem.

Speaking of JavaScript, that's where I took my first coding steps. But the bootcamp had me diving deep into the world of vanilla Ruby, where I got my hands dirty with the fundamentals of OOP. During my work placement, I got to tinker with TypeScript, Microservices, and Next.js (which I used to build my website).

But wait, there's more! Business needs nudged me towards Java and Spring Boot. Now, I'm so comfortable with them, I can see myself becoming a master.

I've also delved into the fundamentals of Domain Driven Design, embraced Hexagonal architecture, and always aimed for a decoupled and fully independent structure (shoutout to SOLID principles).

I've tangled with a variety of other tools too, like AWS services, SQL and NoSQL databases, Jenkins, Kibana, and more.

So, as you can see, I'm always up for learning new languages, frameworks, architectures, and designs. I'm all about expanding my horizons and pushing the boundaries of what I can create. Let's code something amazing together!
